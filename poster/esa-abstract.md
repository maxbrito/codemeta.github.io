Background/Question/Methods 



Software plays an essential and ever-increasing role in almost all ecological analyses, from gathering data in the field or by remote sensing tools to data manipulation, synthesis, analysis and presentation.  Yet while ecology has been groundbreaking in formal archiving, presevation and citation of *data* associated with an analysis, the same care has yet to be extended to software.  This can make it difficult to discover the most appropriate software for a task, provide credit and incentive to academic software authors through citation, or identify and preserve software needed to reproduce previous results.  The CodeMeta Project is an NSF-funded collaboration to define and implement a common set of software metadata by creating a crosswalk between the diverse existing set of software metadata standards.



Results/Conclusions 

This poster presents the resulting consensus for tracking, archiving, preserving, citing, and discovering software through appropriate metadata management.  The approach reflects tools and workflows commonly used in the ecological community, including an implementation of this software archiving and discovery platform in DataONE, the network of most major ecological and environmental data repositories.
